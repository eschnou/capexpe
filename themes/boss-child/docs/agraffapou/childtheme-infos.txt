Hello,

my name is Apou, i worked on the UI of Capexpe, about images, global style, typography and other design stuff.

All actions are listed below:

CSS Styles:
-----------

All custom styles are located in boss-child/css/custom.css

Custom class are commented to explain the style in the file

PHP View:
-----

All custom view are located in the plugin directory OF the child theme (and not in the plugin directory himself, to avoid to overwrite and lost modification by an update)

	BuddyPress Group Extra
	----------------------

	directory: boss-child/bpge

	This plugin displays extra options to manage groups, few options are useless, so we hide theme to avoid to disrupt users and avoid issues.

	we modified 3 files in the /front directory:

	WARNING: since the version 2.1.6 of Boss Theme, some arguments became deprecated, a backup of old files is located in bpge/front/deprecated

		- extras_general.php: LINE 1 + 6 + 15 + 24 add some "hide" class to hide some paragraphs
		- extras_pages_add_edit.php: LINE 22: activate the media-button to add an image in a page by the WYSYG editor
		- extras_top_menu.php: LINE 8 + 10 + 22 + 38 + 51 + 53 + 69 + 71: add some "hide" classe to hide some buttons (deactive fields options)


	BuddyPress
	----------

	directory: boss-child/buddypress

	This plugin is the main plugin to transform Wordpress to a Community portal. A button are useless in the group view, so we hide it.

	We modified one file in the /groups directory:

	index.php: Line 48: Put the action line in comment to hide the seconde button creer une expe (FR). Already displays on the page (next to the title)
